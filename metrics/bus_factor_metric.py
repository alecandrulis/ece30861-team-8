    """
    Calculates a proxy for the bus factor score by searching for contributor
    information within a README file's text.
    NOTE: This is an approximation and less accurate than the API-based method.
    Verbosity is controlled by the passed-in argument (0=silent, 1=INFO, 2=DEBUG).

    Args:
        readme_content (str): The full text content of the README file.
        verbosity (int): The verbosity level (0, 1, or 2).
        log_queue (multiprocessing.Queue): The queue for centralized logging.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - The bus factor score (1.0 if contributor info is mentioned, 0.0 otherwise).
        - The total time spent (float).
